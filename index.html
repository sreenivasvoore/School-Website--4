There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.</p>

    <p class="text-muted">The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier’s. For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for.</p>

      The food options and responsiilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and 
      much efficient than they have been in the past. Before: The seating at the canteen is 
      pretty awful; the chairs look more ancient than the college. They say you haven’t
       really studied at St. Xavier’s unless you’ve gotten at least two splinters from 
       the furniture. They don’t actually, but they really ought to update the college 
       motto. Then there’s the bit about there being no internet connectivity so you 
       can’t Instagram pictures of your BMS Pav, that’s just brutally medieval.</p>
